# Machine Learning Path Repository 
This repository is designed for efficient Data Preprocessing and model creation for EARS (Emergency Assistance and Routing System). Our approach involves utilizing an android-based application built on the Google Maps API and employing content-based filtering techniques to determine the nearest path and recommend hospitals to the user. To ensure seamless integration, we plan to convert the model into tflite (TensorFlow Lite) format at the final stage. This enables the model to be deployed efficiently on resource-constrained devices while maintaining its functionality and accuracy.
