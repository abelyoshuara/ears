# EARS  (Emergency Automated Responce System)
EARS Project 
An Android mobile-based emergency call application that simplifies the process for patients to call an ambulance. It utilizes geolocation filtering, allowing users to quickly access the nearest ambulance during a crisis to overcome the critical "golden hours."
In addition to emergencies, users can search for nearby hospitals and easily locate them through Google Maps for added convenience.
