# EARS  (Emergency Automated Responce System)
EARS Project 
An Android mobile-based emergency call application that simplifies the process for patients to call an ambulance. It utilizes geolocation filtering, allowing users to quickly access the nearest ambulance during a crisis to overcome the critical "golden hours."
In addition to emergencies, users can search for nearby hospitals and easily locate them through Google Maps for added convenience.
# Machine Learning Path Repository 
This repository used for Data Preprocessing and creating the model for EARS. We use android-based on gmaps API and content based filtering for chhosing the nearest path and recomendation hospital for user. At the end of the model =, we will transform the model to tflite
# Work Flow 
1. Data Collecting 
2. Gmaps API Processing
3. Creating Model of Recommendation Hospital 
4. Convert to TF-Lite
5. Deploy to Android
